	About this page:
	(What inspired me for this webpage was the aesthetic of a crazy cat lady. Also of using some silly gifs and pics of animals to tie in the craziness of y2k. I also got the idea of wanting to make like a crazy cat lady club inspired webpage. I dont know, I thought it was funny. All the cat names are from the actual publisher and other names mentioned are not real people.)-->

<!--This was a long, educational, and interesting process. I will say, coming from a background with absolutely no coding knowledge, it was a lot to try and pick up. Even though it took me a long time to understand the meanings of each code, I got the hang of it after a while. It had taken me in the span of two separate hours to center an image. There was probably an easier way to center the image, but my brain just couldn't pick up on where to place things and when to close them. Also, Discord has been a HUGE help since some of the questions that were asked were some questions I had of my own. My webpage is really simple, but I am proud that I have gotten that far. I'm excited to learn more and improve for better webpages in the future!-->
